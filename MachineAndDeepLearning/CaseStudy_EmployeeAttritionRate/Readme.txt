Technique used for feature engineering:
a) Filling null values with median
b) Creating dummies for categorical data
c) One hot encoding and one hot encoding with multiple values to handle cataegorical data.

Technique used for Feature Selection:
a) Heatmap: Selecting relevant features after calculating of  correlations of each features in dataset.
	Negative correlation mean output is inversly proportional to the input variable.
	Positive correlation means output is Directly proportional to the input variable.

Technique for algorithm optimization:
a) Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
